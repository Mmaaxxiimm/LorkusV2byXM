                <p>Today, I am Head of Sales Excellence at bpost. For 24 years I’ve been working for bpost, a company acting in constantly changing market conditions.

                <p>
                That is why I was one of the driving forces behind an internal leadership program aimed at improving our corporate culture. I saw the impact this has on an organization. With b2b I want to bring this to as many people and their organizations as possible.</p>

                            We offer x modules devided into 3 themes (I, you and i, we). Modules can also be choosen a la carte. We will always make sure the combination makes an interesting story. This story is brought to you either as a training (including workshop on ‘how to deal with the learnings in practive’) or as a lecture/keynote.

                            The concepts that are covered in each of the modules are easy to understand, practical and ready to use, whatever you position, whatever your sector. Moreover, the new insights are not only applicable at work but are also of use in your private life.

                            You should plan 30’ min. to 90’ max. per module. Each of the modules can be extended with a workshop on “how to deal with the learnings in practice”. Add min. 15’ to max. 30’ per workshop.
